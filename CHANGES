= 0.4.0 - 8-Dec-2016
* The Configuration constructor no longer requires a subscription ID. However,
  the presence of a subscription ID is still required for almost all Service
  classes. The verification now happens later, within the Service constructor.
* Added the SubscriptionService class. This does not require a subscription ID
  in advance, so you can get a list of subscriptions for a tenant.
* The Configuration#subscription_id= and Configuration#proxy= writer methods
  now have custom implementations.

= 0.3.13 - 30-Nov-2016
* Fixed the Billing::Usage model class name.
* Updated the Billing::Usage#list method so that it returns an ArmrestCollection
  instead of a plain array. In addition, it now supports an :all option so
  that you don't have to deal with continuation tokens.

= 0.3.12 - 15-Nov-2016
* Added the Insights::DiagnosticService class.
* Added the get_from_vm and get_os_disk methods to StorageAccountService.
* Added the delete_associated_resources method to VirtualMachineService.
* The output of StorageAccount#blob_properties method now includes the blob
  name and the container name.
* Added a service_name accessor to the ArmrestService base class.
* The list_all method in StorageAccountService now supports a filter.

= 0.3.11 - 8-Nov-2016
* Fixed the regex for the internal method parse_id_string, making the
  get_associated_resource method more robust.
* The get_associated_resource now supports VM extensions.
* The list and list_all methods for the ResourceService class now
  optionally return all possible results instead of capping at 1000.
* Some updates for codeclimate-test-reporter, simplecov.

= 0.3.10 - 28-Oct-2016
* Added the ResourceGroupBasedService#get_associated_resource method. This
  method will retrieve a service or subservice resource based on an ID string.

= 0.3.9 - 19-Oct-2016
* The StorageAccount#delete_blob method now returns a ResponseHeaders object
  instead of true.
* The Configuration.clear_caches method now additionally clears the
  CacheMethod config store.

= 0.3.8 - 7-Oct-2-16
* Added more robust exception wrapping, now mostly based on http error code.
* Refactored the internal fetch_providers method so that it uses our own
  service class method call, which is cached.
* Added the TemplateDeploymentService#get_template method.
* The :list and :list_all methods in the ResourceGroupBasedService class now
  automatically perform pagination.
* Replaced our custom inspect with the one provided by pretty_print.
* Added the :response_code and :response_headers accessors to the BaseModel
  class. All individual objects and collections now set these.
* Modified our :poll method to check the :response_code, and to try the
  :location attribute if :azure_asyncoperation isn't found.
* Updated the :create documentation for the StorageAccountService class.

= 0.3.7 - 15-Sep-2016
* Modified the private image listing code in the StorageAccountService class
  to skip over storage accounts when we cannot get a key.

= 0.3.6 - 13-Sep-2016
* Added the poll and wait methods to the ArmrestService base class. These
  are meant for use with asynchronous operations, e.g. create and delete.
* All methods that returned a plain array now return an ArmrestCollection
  object instead. This is a subclass of Array, but includes header and
  skip token information.
* Added the ArmrestCollection.create_from_response method. This creates
  and returns a collection based on a JSON response and a model type.
* Minor update to the ApiException#to_s method so that includes a bit
  more information.

= 0.3.5 - 11-Aug-2016
* When we added subscription ID validation in 0.3.2 we forgot to set proxy
  information first. That has been fixed.

= 0.3.4 - 9-Aug-2016
* Modified the StorageAccount#blobs and StorageAccount#containers method. Both
  now accept a hash of options that you can use to modify the results. Also,
  both now automatically handle continuation tokens to collect all results.
* The ResourceGroupBasedService#delete method now returns a ResponseHeaders
  object instead of nil. Furthermore, it will raise an error on a 204 response
  which indicates that the resource wasn't actually found.
* Added the Network::LoadBalancerService and Network::InboundNatService classes.
* Added the Network::RouteService and Network::RouteTableService classes.

= 0.3.3 - 1-Aug-2016
* Added the :max_threads configuration option. This is used internally wherever
  the Parallel gem is used.
* The default number of threads when used with VCR is reduced to 1.

= 0.3.2 - 21-Jul-2016
* The subscription ID is now automatically validated in the
  Azure::Armrest::Configuration constructor.
* Added a Hakiri badge to the README.
* There have been some minor updates to the dependencies to enforce
  more recent versions of external gems, as suggested by Hakiri,
  for security reasons.
* The ResourceGroupBasedService#list_all method (and all subclasses)
  now supports an optional hash that can be used to automatically
  filter result sets.

= 0.3.1 - 14-Jul-2016
* Now uses the parallel gem and thread pools for those few methods where
  we were using threaded methods internally in order to reduce errors
  caused by too many requests.
* Updated the rest-client dependency to 2.0.0 now that it has been released.
* Updated travis.yml to only test 2.2.5 and 2.3.1 for now. Partly due to a
  change in the activesupport gem.
* One rspec fix for 2.3.x.

= 0.3.0 - 28-Jun-2016
* The configuration handling has been moved into its own class called
  Azure::Armrest::Configuration. You can call this explicitly using :new,
  or you can still use ArmrestService.configure.
* The :subscription_id option for configuration is no longer optional.
  The logic for automatically fetching the first active subscription ID
  that could be found has been dropped.
* Added the Billing::UsageService class.
* Added a TooManyRequests exception.
* Added support for pretty_print.
* Added the addressable gem as a dependency, as it internally replaces
  the uri standard library. Calls to rest-client are still encoded, but
  now using Addressable::URI.
* StorageAccountService no longer does account type validation.
* Added the StorageAccountService#list_all_private_images method.

= 0.2.10 - 15-Sep-2016
* Backported PR #213 (skip over storage accounts that don't have keys).

= 0.2.9 - 25-Aug-2016
* Backported PR #211 (exception class updates and specs).

= 0.2.8 - 22-Jul-2016
* Backported PR #188 (add list_all_private_images method).
* Backported PR #194 (updated .travis.yml).

= 0.2.7 - 20-Jun-2016
* All internal calls to rest-client are now explicitly URI.encoded.

= 0.2.6 - 9-May-2016
* If no subscription is provided, the internal method for fetching a default
  subscription ID will now skip over tenant/subscription mismatches.
* Removed the hard-coded api-version string for both TemplateDeploymentService
  and StorageAccountService.
* Because there was an underlying REST API change for storage account keys for
  api-version strings set at 2016-01-01 or later, the list_account_key_objects
  and regenerate_account_key_objects methods were added. These return model
  objects instead of plain hashes. The list_account_keys and regenerate_account_keys
  methods still behave as before.

= 0.2.5 - 11-Apr-2016
* Fixed a bug in the custom exception handler where the error code and
  message were not set properly.

= 0.2.4 - 4-Apr-2016
* The ArmrestCollection#skip_token method was renamed to "continuation_token".
* Added the ArmrestService.log and ArmrestService.log= methods. These are just
  thin wrappers around RestClient.log and RestClient.log= methods.
* Fixed the StorageAccount#table_data method, and added support for
  continuation tokens.
* Fixed a bug in the BaseModel's method generation code where an all-caps
  key would create strange results. 
* Dealt with a bug in the StorageAccountService#create method caused by
  a potentially empty response.

= 0.2.3 - 29-Mar-2016
* Fixed the VirtualMachineImageService class.
* Added an Insights::MetricsService class and support models.
* Added a singleton method to clear some internal class variable caches that
  we use. This is primarily meant for testing.
* Added a customs collection class that will eventually be used for better
  handling of skip tokens (paging).
* Updated the Insights::Event class, modifying the list method's prototype,
  and now it returns our custom collection class.

= 0.2.2 - 16-Mar-2016
* Fixed a potential name collision issue for nested objects.

= 0.2.1 - 15-Mar-2016
* The ssl_version and ssl_verify options are now supported by, and
  automatically passed on to, StorageAccount model objects.
* Added the get_blob_raw method to get at raw blob data. Use wisely.
* Nested model objects are now named based on the attribute name rather
  than anonymous.

= 0.2.0 - 10-Mar-2016
* The Armrest.configure method now supports the :ssl_verify and :ssl_version
  options. By default, the ssl_version option is set to TLSv1 instead of
  using older defaults used by Ruby's net-http library.

= 0.1.3 - 7-Mar-2016
* StorageAccount model objects now have their proxy value automatically
  set to whatever the proxy was set to in the configuration argument
  for StorageAccountService.

= 0.1.2 - 2-Mar-2016
* When selecting the appropriate api version string, we now reject dates
  that are ahead of the current date.
* Some minor rubocop cleanup.

= 0.1.1 - 26-Feb-2016
* Added proxy support for both the storage model and main configure method.
* Added the SqlDatabaseService and SqlServerService classes.
* Added the ResourceGroupBaseedSubservice abstract base class.
* When fetching a default subscription, enabled subscriptions are chosen
  before disabled subscriptions. If only a disabled subscription can be
  found then a warning is issued.
* You can now create blobs and blob snapshots with the storage model.
  Thanks go to Alexandre Lamandé and Nguyễn Tấn Tài and for their patches.
* Some internal refactoring to use our own helper methods for various
  RestClient methods, and other cleanup.

= 0.1.0 - 26-Jan-2015
* Refactored the ArmrestService class api_version and provider handling.
* The ArmrestService class no longer uses "preview" api versions by default.
* Added RBAC service classes.

= 0.0.9 - 17-Dec-2015
* Added AlertService and EventService classes.
* Added tables, table_info and table_data methods to the StorageAccount model.
* Updates to the README.

= 0.0.8 - 10-Nov-2015
* Added the list_private_images method to the StorageAccountService class.
* Added the list_all method to the ResourceGroupService class.
* Removed the EventService class for now. It did not actually work, and will
  eventually be re-implemented as part of a group of Insights classes.
* Added a .to_h and .to_hash method for the BaseModel class.

= 0.0.7 - 5-Nov-2015
* Refactored our BaseModel class so that it no longer uses Delegate or OpenStruct.
* Added more methods to the StorageAccount model, and modified methods so that
  any options are always the last argument.
* Bug fix for the StorageAccount#all_blobs method.

= 0.0.6 - 23-Oct-2015
* Defined a custom == method for the BaseModel class.
* The TemplateDeployment#properties.outputs now returns a hash.
* Temporarily use a BaseModel hash ref instead of a method name due to name
  collision with ManageIQ until a general solution is worked out.

= 0.0.5 - 21-Oct-2015
* The VirtualMachineService#series method now returns VirtualMachineSize
  objects instead of a raw hash.
* Fixed a bug in the Network::IpAddress::Service class.
* Cleaned up some spec warnings.

= 0.0.4 - 19-Oct-2015
* All get/list/list_all methods now return wrapper class instances, e.g.
  a call to VirtualMachineService#get will return a VirtualMachine instance.
  These provide a nice OpenStruct wrapper so you can use methods instead
  of hash references if desired.
* A custom StorageAccount class was added that implements methods for
  gathering blob information.
* Most service classes now inherit from ResourceGroupBasedService, which
  provides a common set of methods typically used for various services.
* Now re-raises RestClient exceptions as exceptions that we have defined.
* The VirtualMachineImage class was overhauled and is now working properly.
* The azure-signature, nokogiri and activesupport dependencies were added.

= 0.0.3 - 13-Oct-2015
* Bug fixes for VirtualMachineImageService class.
* Reorganized and updated SubnetService class.
* Some updates to the BaseModel in prep for JSON wrapper classes.
* Added NetworkSecurityGroupService and IpAddressService classes.

= 0.0.2 - 23-Sep-2015
* Revamped class names. Now use "Service" instead of "Manager".
* Several new service classes added, updated, and refactored.
* All service classes now take and store configuration information as the
  first argument to ensure distinct credentials.
* Added Bill Wei as author.

= 0.0.1 - 13-Aug-2015
* Initial release
